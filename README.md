# Connect_4
Author: LucasRoberts

A simple game of Connect 4 using Pygame.
This project is mostly practice for me to familiarize myself more with OOP. The player(s) will have the option to select which block to place their piece in and it will alternate until a player gets 4 in a row or all 42 positions are filled.
