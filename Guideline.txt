    BOARD [7 wide x 6 height]

Plan
    Board:
        Create the board (Maybe Pygame or Turtle (Turtle being the easier option))
        Create Holes for the pieces
        Allow pieces to stop at the right areas
    Pieces:
        Create Checker pieces (Black & White Pieces)
        Piece Gravity
        Keep their location until the game restarts
        Can't be moved or influenced after they're placed
    Player:
        Create two players
        Update & Store moves (maybe in an array)
        Create player_move class to allow placement
        Deny the ability for someone to place if its not their turn
        Alternate turns
    End game:
        Player gets 4 pieces in a row in any direction
        All slots are filled
        A player quits/ff


What do I need to work on now?
    Turns
        I need to track where the player clicks
        send that to the pieces class
        and then place the piece while including gravity
        I need to know where to place the pieces in terms of coords

    Pieces
        I have to track turn it is and choose the piece accordingly
        use the choose_player function to decide this...
